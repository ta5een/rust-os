# About this project

`rust-os` is a small operating system written in, unsurprisingly, Rust. It
follows Phill Oppermann's blog "[Writing an OS in Rust][os-blog]". This is a
small project that only benefits me and my understanding of how operating
systems work. I don't expect it to grow into a large, independent OS with a
thriving ecosystem capable of luring thousands of users. Alas, this is my first
step into learning the processes of operating system development and the
essential functions of how the kernel, and thus the operating systems we use
today, communicates to its underlying hardware. I am no computer scientist or
someone knowledgeable of low-level programming, but I hope for this project to
be an immense source of knowledge for myself in this field.
