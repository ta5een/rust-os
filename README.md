# `rust-os`

## About this project

`rust-os` is a small operating system written in, unsurprisingly, the Rust
programming language. It follows Phill Oppermann's approachable blog "[Writing
an OS in Rust][os-blog]".

This is a small project that only benefits me. I don't expect it to grow into a
large, independent OS with a thriving ecosystem capable of luring thousands of
users. Instead, this is me dipping my toes into a new experience that I have
always been curious about.

## My aims

As I go through this project, I aim to discover and understand how OSes really
work and what the process of development, testing and maintaining an OS is like.
Of course, `rust-os` will be entirely inferior to the battle-tested and
time-proven systems out there like Linux and Windows. But I don't aim it to be
perfect or marketable. I just wanna have fun! And what better way to do so than
to build my very own OS?

Perhaps I could create my very own OS in the (far) future. I don't know what
features it would have, but I know that the mistakes and techniques I learn here
will be immensely useful for when I end up doing that. In the meantime, welcome
to my journey into developing `rust-os`!
